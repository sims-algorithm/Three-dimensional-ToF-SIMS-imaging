## Three-dimensional ToF-SIMS Imaging

This repository provides a Python toolkit for three-dimensional ToF-SIMS imaging.  
It aims to reconstruct 3D molecular distributions from serial 2D ToF-SIMS images and includes utilities for data parsing, preprocessing, ROI-based line-profile analysis, and 3D visualization for tissue- and cell-scale studies.

ℹ️ **Project status**

The codebase is currently being organized and refined.  
Some components and example scripts are available, while additional modules and documentation are still under preparation.  
Further updates will be released as the project progresses.
